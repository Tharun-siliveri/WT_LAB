        <h2>Rating:- 8/10</h2>
        <h2>Highlights:-</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Ponniyin Selvan : Part One is director Maniratnam's vision of the epic Tamil novel by Kalki. True to the poster the movie is based on the novel but is purely Maniratnam's movie. It does have some minor deviations in plot narrative which might upset purists.</li>
          <li>The good part about this movie is one does not have to have read the book. Viewers can experience a version of director Maniratnam's PS:1. It does feel a little bit rushed, however those uninitiated to the PS landscape will be able to catch up. The entire cast and crew deserve a major round of applause and kudos. The visuals, cinematography and performances are the highlights of the movie.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Drawbacks:-</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Dare I say, but the parts that annoyed me were that I found the movie highly rushed. I'm no one to judge casting decisions but somehow Lal as Thirukovilur Malayamaan and Mohan Raman as Anirudha Bhramayar didn't quite cut it. Personally, some of the scenes could be a tad brighter and action at times shorter. And Yes, someone else could've played Vanathi.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Finally:-</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>But above all, this is a wonderful movie. Director Maniratnam's effort has to be appreciated. I gave the movie an 8 based on cast, cinematography, costume and art.</li>
        </ul>
